*Homework 1 (Due next week)*
We will modify the code to run it on different images we choose. Choose what you want to classify (i.e. apples vs pears, darth vader vs luke skywalker)
- Download two different types of 50-100 (i.e. 50 apples 50 pears)
- Try modifying the code from before to work on this data

You can use this chrome extension to download images.

To use, just go on Google Image search, type in a query i.e. Darth Vader, click on the extension and select the images you want to save (that are actually of Darth Vader).

We will be going over some theory *next* Sat and hints on how to solve the task. 
At the end of next week we'll be discussing the different results groups found and any insights of looking at different types of images.
