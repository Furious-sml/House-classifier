## homework 0: 2018.02.24: sml-group-study starts
- Run through the current code (Google Colab or your own setup)

## homework 1: 2018.03.03
*Homework 1 (Due next week)*
We will modify the code to run it on different images we choose. Choose what you want to classify (i.e. apples vs pears, darth vader vs luke skywalker)
- Download two different types of 50-100 (i.e. 50 apples 50 pears)
- Try modifying the code from before to work on this data

You can use this chrome extension to download images.

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj

To use, just go on Google Image search, type in a query i.e. Darth Vader, click on the extension and select the images you want to save (that are actually of Darth Vader).

We will be going over some theory *next* Sat and hints on how to solve the task. 
At the end of next week we'll be discussing the different results groups found and any insights of looking at different types of images.

Lastly.... we will be sending a survey for tips and advice how to improve for the future lessons, please let us know how we can improve

## homework 2: 2018.03.10
Fast AI is amazing and easy to use on your own data source. This weeks *Homework (HW 2)* however is to try apply our *Fast ai model from homework 1* to a real world data source on Kaggle and see how you score on the leaderboard. You will need a Kaggle account set up and accept the competition rules in order to download the data set.

Recommended sources for this week are:

- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification

- https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground/data

- https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification

Jeremy has provided his solution file for the dog breed classification in the "DL1" folder called "Kaggle - Dogbreeds" so refer to this Python notebook if you need extra help with this weeks home work.

## homework 3: 2018.03.17
This week's homework will be be applying what you have learned onto other Kaggle datasets to do a *prediction task*. We've picked two datasets that has some real world applications for you to apply your skills to

*Used Car Sales*

## homework 4: 2018.03.24
This weeks homework, ( *homework 4* ) is arguably one of the *most challenging*, but *useful yet*! In order to “look under the hood” as it were & learn usable skills you could mention to potential employers - for this week we would like you to walk through the *“Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 minute Blitz”*  tutorial from the official Pytorch documentation which is located here:

http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

*Please attempt to get through the following steps of the tutorial*:

*1. What is PyTorch?*
*2. Autograd automatic differentiation*
*3. Neural Networks*
*4. Training a Classifier.*

For the more *advanced students* in the class & for those of you who complete the above,
once you have reached the "where do I go next” section in the above, we would like you like you to complete the PyTorch NLP  tutorial to build a basic sentiment analysis classifier:
