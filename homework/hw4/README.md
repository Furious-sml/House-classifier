## homework

This weeks homework, ( *homework 4* ) is arguably one of the *most challenging*, but *useful yet*! In order to “look under the hood” as it were & learn usable skills you could mention to potential employers - for this week we would like you to walk through the *“Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 minute Blitz”*  tutorial from the official Pytorch documentation which is located here:

http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html

*Please attempt to get through the following steps of the tutorial*:

*1. What is PyTorch?*
*2. Autograd automatic differentiation*
*3. Neural Networks*
*4. Training a Classifier.*

For the more *advanced students* in the class & for those of you who complete the above,
once you have reached the "where do I go next” section in the above, we would like you like you to complete the PyTorch NLP  tutorial to build a basic sentiment analysis classifier:
