## homework

Thanks all for coming. Hopefully you are now familiar with setting up the environment.

If you are still having issues we *highly recommend* using Google Colab. It's free and easier to run . Click this link and open it in Playground (top left).

You can just click play to run the code :slightly_smiling_face:

It's free for 12 hours at a time (more than enough to run a project), after which you need to open it again.

*Homework 0*
- Run through the current code (Google Colab or your own setup)

*Homework 1 (Due next week)*
We will modify the code to run it on different images we choose. Choose what you want to classify (i.e. apples vs pears, darth vader vs luke skywalker)
- Download two different types of 50-100 (i.e. 50 apples 50 pears)
- Try modifying the code from before to work on this data

You can use this chrome extension to download images.

To use, just go on Google Image search, type in a query i.e. Darth Vader, click on the extension and select the images you want to save (that are actually of Darth Vader).

We will be going over some theory *next* Sat and hints on how to solve the task. 
At the end of next week we'll be discussing the different results groups found and any insights of looking at different types of images.

Lastly.... we will be sending a survey for tips and advice how to improve for the future lessons, please let us know how we can improve
